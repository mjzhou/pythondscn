# 1.2快速开始

The way we think about programming has undergone many changes in the years since the first electronic computers required patch cables and switches to convey instructions from human to machine. As is the case with many aspects of society, changes in computing technology provide computer scientists with a growing number of tools and platforms on which to practice their craft. Advances such as faster processors, high-speed networks, and large memory capacities have created a spiral of complexity through which computer scientists must navigate. Throughout all of this rapid evolution, a number of basic principles have remained constant. The science of computing is concerned with using computers to solve problems.

You have no doubt spent considerable time learning the basics of problem-solving and hopefully feel confident in your ability to take a problem statement and develop a solution. 你也知道写计算机程序一般是困难的。 The complexity of large problems and the corresponding complexity of the solutions can tend to overshadow the fundamental ideas related to the problem-solving process.



本章详述了两个重要领域的内容。首先,它回顾了计算机科学、算法研究、数据结构在内的适应框架体系,特别是,为什么我们需要学习这些方面和理解这些方面是如何帮助我们成为解决问题效率更高的人。第二,我们复习了Python编程语言。虽然我们不能提供一份详细的,详尽的参考,但我们将会在剩下的章节里为基本的结构和解法给出例子和解释。
